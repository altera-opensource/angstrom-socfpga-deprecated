These are the setup scripts for the Angstrom buildsystem. If you want to (re)build packages or images for Angstrom, this is the thing to use.
The Angstrom buildsystem is using various components from the Yocto Project, most importantly the Openembedded buildsystem, the bitbake task executor and various application and BSP layers.

This is the Angstrom Distribution v2014.12 release.

To configure the scripts and download the build metadata, do:

	$ MACHINE=cyclone5 ./oebb.sh config cyclone5

You can change the 'cyclone5' in the commandline above into arria5 or arria10.

To start a build of the kernel, source the environment file and do:

	$ . environment-angstrom-v2014.12
	$ MACHINE=cyclone5 bitbake virtual/kernel

For an example workflow for dealing with kernels please read http://www.slimlogic.co.uk/2011/05/openembeddedangstrom-kernel-workflow/

To update the metadata, do:

	$ git pull
	$ ./oebb.sh update

The oebb.sh script tries hard to keep your local changes while at the same time keeping close to the original config. Please keep the following in mind:

	* it will reset the origin URI based on layers.txt, so update layers.txt when changing a repo
	* it will do a 'git reset --hard <ref>' on locked down repos, so please create a new branch for your changes
	* As noted above, it will NOT switch branches, so be carefull when using the update function after you branched a repo
